      <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>
      <p>
        HTML and CSS are two languages used for webpage creation and styling. Together, they can be used to make a webpage,
        with HTML defining the elements of the page (text, images, etc.) and CSS being used to style those elements with
        properties (colour, width, alignment, etc.).

      <h2 class="dark">HTML</h2>
      <p class="dark">
        Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1980, HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It is a standard
        markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using
        HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. These tags are used to specify the
        element being added, for example the &lt;p&gt; tage is used to specify a paragraph, (like this one), and the
        &lt;img&gt; is used to specify an image.
        <br />
        It’s also worth noting that HTML is not technically considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic
        functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and
        develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.
      </p>
      <h2 class="dark">CSS</h2>
      <p class="dark">
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets language and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as
        HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site. The relation between HTML and CSS is
        strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire
        website.
        <br />
        CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996 for a rather simple reason. HTML element was not
        designed to have tags that would help format the page. You were only supposed to write the markup for the web page.
        Tags like &lt;font&gt; were introduced in HTML version 3.2, and it caused quite a lot of trouble for web developers.
        Due to the fact that web pages have different fonts, colored backgrounds, and multiple styles, it was a long,
        painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by W3C to solve this problem. CSS is not
        technically a necessity, but you probably wouldn’t want to look at a web page that features only HTML elements as it
        would look completely bare-boned.
