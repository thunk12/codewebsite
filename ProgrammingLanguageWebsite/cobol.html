        HTML and CSS are two languages used for webpage creation and styling. Together, they can be used to make a webpage,
        with HTML defining the elements of the page (text, images, etc.) and CSS being used to style those elements with
        properties (colour, width, alignment, etc.).

      <p class="dark">
        COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language for business applications. It was the
        first popular language designed to be operating system-agnostic and is still in use in many financial and business
        applications today. COBOL was designed for business computer programs in industries such as finance and human
        resources. Unlike some high-level computer programming languages, COBOL uses English words and phrases to make it
        easier for ordinary business users to understand. The language was based on Rear Admiral Grace Hopper's 1940s work on
        the FLOW-MATIC programming language, which was also largely text-based. Hopper, who worked as a technical consultant
        on the FLOW-MATIC project, is sometimes referred to as the "grandmother of COBOL." Before COBOL, all operating
        systems had their own associated programming languages. This was a problem for companies that used multiple brands of
        computers, as was the case with the United States Department of Defense, which backed the COBOL project. Because of
        its ease of use and portability, COBOL quickly became one of the most used programming languages in the world.
        Although the language is widely viewed as outdated, more lines of code in active use today are written in COBOL than
        any other programming language.
